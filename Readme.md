Smart Home Systems Assignment
----------

Your task is to create a smart home system (SHM) which will
facilitate residents through automation. The system will use the
smartphone GPS (which everybody carry around most of the time) to
locate the user (imagine the smartphone always send the GPS location
to the smart home system). 

For example, when you drive back home. As you reach the vicinity of
the house (within 2Km radius), the SHM will turn on your aircond and
turn on water heater. As you reach 5 meters away from the garage door,
the SHM will open it to allow you to park. As you park, the garage will 
automatically shut the door. As you walk to the kitchen, the light
will automatically turned on.

Assume you don't have the GPS device and you have not decided which
GPS chip to use. But you know the GPS has the following common
GPS API:

typedef struct GpsCoordinate GpsCoordinate;
struct GpsCoordinate {
  int x;
  int y;   
};
 
void getGpsCoordinate(GpsCoordinate *gps);
 
Implement the main function of the SHM called "doSmartThings()".
The function calls the GPS function given to find out the location
of the owner and do the smart things explained above.

Assume the house is located at x=200, y=5345. The outside garage
door is at x=220, y=5300. The center of the garage is x=215,
y=5300 (5m radius). And the center of the kitchen is x=196, y=5400 
(50m radius). 

You have following API for smart home control:

typedef enum {
  GARAGE_DOOR,
  KITCHEN_LIGHT,
  AIRCOND,
  WATER_HEATER,
} Device;

typedef enum {
  OFF,
  ON
} State;

void turn(Device device, State state);

Eg. turn(KITCHEN_LIGHT, ON);
    turn(WATER_HEATER, OFF);
